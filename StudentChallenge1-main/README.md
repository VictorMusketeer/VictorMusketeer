# Allan Gray Student Challenge 1

Welcome to the Allan Gray Student Challenge. In this challenge we will present you with a small game that we would like you to complete for us. The majority of the game has already been coded, but there are certain components that need to be completed in order for it to work correctly. 

To participate, fork the current repo to your own GitHub account where you can then work on it in your own space. 

If you believe you have solved the problem, please email us with a link to your cloned repo at itrecruitment@allangray.co.za

The first student to send through the correct answer will win a R500 Takealot voucher. The repo will be up from April 30th 2021, where you will have until the 7th May 2021 to complete the challenge. The winner will only be announced after the challenge has been closed.

# AG Number Scramble
The purpose of this little game is to put the numbers that are displayed, in the right order. In the game, set of eight squares will be displayed, where you as a player need to solve it by moving the tiles around and placing them in the correct order. 

The majority of the game is in working order, but there are certain modules that need code in order for the game to work correctly. 

The application is contained in the main.js file. All parts that need to be completed can be found in that file.
